PROJECT TITLE:
Epoka Book Hub

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Despite the growing availability of online resources, many university students frequently encounter challenges in locating the required textbooks and supplementary materials prescribed by their professors for each course. This struggle arises due to several factors, including fragmented online platforms, inconsistent availability of course materials, and a lack of centralized resources tailored to their specific academic needs. As a result, students often face unnecessary stress, delays in acquiring essential textbooks, and increased financial burdens associated with purchasing materials from various sources. Addressing these difficulties is crucial to enhancing students' educational experiences and ensuring equitable access to learning resources.

SOLUTION PROPOSAL:
Introducing a centralized online platform specifically designed for students and professors at our university to easily access and procure required course materials. This user-friendly website will feature a comprehensive database where professors can upload their syllabi along with the corresponding textbook lists and recommended readings for each course. Students will be able to search for their courses and instantly access the necessary materials, eliminating the need to scour multiple sources.


PROJECT SCOPE:
The scope of this project encompasses the development and implementation of a user-friendly online platform tailored specifically for the students and professors of our university. The platform will serve as a centralized hub for accessing and procuring required course materials, including textbooks and supplementary readings.
1.User Registration and Authentication
Students and professors will be able to securely use the system only if they log in with the university accounts.
2.Course Material Upload
Professors will have the ability to upload syllabi and corresponding textbook lists for each of their courses.
3.Search and Browse Functionality
Students will be able to search for courses by department or professor's name, and browse through available course materials.
4.Seamless Procurement Options
Students will have the option to purchase or rent textbooks directly through the platform, with links to trusted vendors for streamlined transactions.
5.Administrative Tools
Administrative functionalities will be included to manage user accounts, monitor platform activity, and provide support as needed.

Limitations:
1.Content Accuracy
The platform relies on professors to accurately upload course materials. Therefore, inaccuracies in the provided information may occur, leading to potential confusion or dissatisfaction among users.
2.Scalability
As the platform grows in popularity and user base, scalability challenges may arise regarding server capacity, performance optimization, and resource allocation, necessitating ongoing monitoring and optimization efforts.
3.Geographic Limitations
The platform will be accessible to students and professors within the university community. However, it will not extend its services beyond the geographic boundaries of the university's jurisdiction.

Boundaries:
1.Content Scope
The platform will focus mainly on providing access to course materials, including textbooks and supplementary readings that are uploaded by professors. It will not serve as a platform for general book sales or unrelated educational resources.
2.Vendor Relationships
While the platform will facilitate transactions with trusted vendors for textbook purchasing, it will not enter into exclusive partnerships or endorse specific vendors beyond providing links for user convenience.
3. Academic Integrity
The platform will uphold academic integrity standards by providing access to legitimate course materials uploaded by professors. It will not condone or facilitate the distribution of unauthorized or pirated content.
4.Data Usage
User data collected by the platform will be used only for the purposes of platform functionality, user support, and administrative operations. It will not be shared with third parties for commercial purposes in accordance with relevant privacy regulations.
